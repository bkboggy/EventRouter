# EventRouter

This is a .NET event routing system, which allows broadcasting of events to subscribers.  The primary reason for its creation was the fact that I needed a custom event/message routing mechanism that would allow more flexibility than what was already available.  While there are some nice mechanism in some of the MVVM frameworks, I found that they did not work 100% as I'd like them to.  So, this is yet another option of achieving said results.

I'll keep updating this project and this readme file as development continues.
